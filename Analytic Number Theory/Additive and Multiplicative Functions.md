A function $f:\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{C}$ is additive if it satisfies:
$$f(mn) = f(m)+f(n)$$
for $m,n$ relatively prime. It is called completely additive if it holds for all $m,n$.
Similarly a function $f:\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{C}$ is multiplicative if it satisfies:
$$f(mn) = f(m)f(n)$$
for $m,n$ relatively prime, and $f$ is called completely multiplicative if the property holds for all $m,n$.
Clearly, the additive and multiplicative functions are determined by their values at prime powers...
