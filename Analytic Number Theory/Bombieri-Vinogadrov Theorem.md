For every $A > 0$ there exists a $B>0$ so that
$$
\sum_{q \le Q} \underset{(a,q)=1}{\max}\underset{y \le x}{\max}\left| \psi(x;q,a)-\frac{x}{\phi(q)} \right| \ll \frac{x}{(\log x)^A}
$$
provided that $Q \le \frac{x^{1/2}}{(\log x)^B}$
#### Remarks:
The key ideas to establish the proof are
1. Bilinear forms and Vaughan's identity
2. Primes in arithmetic progression and Siegel zeros
3. Large sieve inequalities
(Note: I absolutely love this theorem.)
