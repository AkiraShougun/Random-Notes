Let us denote $K_0(Var/ \mathbb{C})$ as the Grothendieck ring of varieties over $\mathbb{C}$. As an abelian group, it is generated by isomorphism classes of quasi-projectice varieties over $\mathbb{C}$ modulo the following relations:

$$
X = U+Z.
$$
[X]=[X/V]+[V]
[XxY] = [X] .[Y]

$[\mathbb{P}^n]$

1. [{\mathbb P}^n] = ? (class of projective space in Grothendieck ring of varieties)
    
2. [Gr(2,4)] = ? (class of Grassmannian of planes (through origin) in {\mathbb A}^4 in Grothendieck ring of varieties) â€“ harder
    
$|{\mathbb {P}}^n_{{\mathbb {F}}_q}|$ = ? (number of points of projective $n$-space over a finite field with q elements)
